These kinds of coding tests are given to coders who are looking for a job, so I was also one of them, 
so thought of uploading this stuff here. Hope you guys find this useful. 

Instructions:

1. Run the "index.html" file.

2. Click on the images to rotate. This would rotate the image by 45 deg on each click and can be rotated 360 deg if clicked 8 times.

Note: The UI has been kept very simple and minimum.
